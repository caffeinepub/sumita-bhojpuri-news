# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the Hindi brand name "सुमिता भोजपुरी न्यूज़" with "सुमिता भोजपुरी समाचार" everywhere it appears, and clean up the sticky header to look professional like a major news portal.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all occurrences of "सुमिता भोजपुरी न्यूज़" with "सुमिता भोजपुरी समाचार" in all frontend source files (Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, index.html, any other components) and backend sample data in main.mo
- Leave the English brand name "Sumita Bhojpuri News" unchanged wherever it appears
- Refine the sticky header layout to be clean and uncluttered: streamlined logo/brand area, evenly spaced and legible navigation links, compact and well-aligned search bar, no redundant visual elements
- Preserve the saffron-red (#D0021B) accent color on the category navigation bar
- Preserve the dark/light mode toggle in the header
- Ensure the header is fully responsive on both mobile and desktop

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays "सुमिता भोजपुरी समाचार" as the Hindi brand name throughout, and the header looks clean, professional, and well-structured on all screen sizes.
