  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-9 and REQ-10. REQ-9 is addressed by replacing 'सुमिता भोजपुरी न्यूज़' with 'सुमिता भोजपुरी समाचार' in Header.tsx and Footer.tsx, while leaving 'Sumita Bhojpuri News' intact. REQ-10 is addressed via a refactored sticky header in Header.tsx with brand bar, compact search, theme toggle, and category nav. However, there is no evidence that the backend file main.mo was checked or updated, and index.html is not confirmed to have been checked for the Hindi string.",
